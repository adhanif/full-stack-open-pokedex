In the world of JavaScript, linting, testing, and building are crucial steps in a CI setup. For linting, tools like ESLint or JSHint are widely used. Testing can be managed through frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine, while building often involves tools like Webpack or Parcel.

Now, alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI in JavaScript include GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and Bitbucket Pipelines. Each has its strengths, and the choice might depend on factors like integration requirements and team preferences.

As for the self-hosted versus cloud-based dilemma, it's a familiar conundrum. Cloud-based solutions like GitHub Actions or CircleCI offer scalability and convenience, while self-hosted options like Jenkins provide more control over infrastructure. The decision often boils down to project needs, team expertise, and resource availability.

For a small project with limited resources, a cloud-based solution might be more practical. It minimizes maintenance hassles and provides an environment that scales with the project's growth. However, larger enterprises with specific security or compliance requirements might opt for the control offered by a self-hosted CI setup.
